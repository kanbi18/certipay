# certipay - Certified Payments App

## Abstract

#### My main aim is to create a native app using flutter which allows users to have verifiable transactions across a group of users based on preset agreements.

## Project Description

#### The objective of the project is to use smart contracts to allow users to make concrete contracts without the thought of fraud in such deals. Possible uses would be within fantasy leagues or when trying to incentivize an individual to perform a task such as chores or weight loss. The front end would be built using Flutter which allows for native development so the app can be cross-platform. The main purpose of using cryptocurrency is it ensures transparency via the blockchain as well as ensures international payments at low fees.
